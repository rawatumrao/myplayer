 This is how to enable FontAwesome icons we licensed using package manager

Configure access for your Project
To authenticate when using npm, create a .npmrc file in the root of your project (or wherever your package.json file lives). Then add the following snippet:
@awesome.me:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
@fortawesome:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
//npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken=5BE4CEF5-A20F-4843-9B6E-82AF033C4212
Install Icons in your Project
Once access is set up, you can now install your Font Awesome Kit as a package via npm.
npm install --save '@awesome.me/kit-fdadaa89ad@latest'
Updating your Package
If you add, remove, or edit icons or styles in your Kit, you'll need to update your package to get the latest changes.
npm update '@awesome.me/kit-fdadaa89ad'

its pretty simple if you have any issues let me know
