 This is how to enable FontAwesome icons we licensed using package manager

Configure access for your Project
To authenticate when using npm, create a .npmrc file in the root of your project (or wherever your package.json file lives). Then add the following snippet:
@awesome.me:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
@fortawesome:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
//npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken=5BE4CEF5-A20F-4843-9B6E-82AF033C4212
Install Icons in your Project
Once access is set up, you can now install your Font Awesome Kit as a package via npm.
npm install --save '@awesome.me/kit-fdadaa89ad@latest'
Updating your Package
If you add, remove, or edit icons or styles in your Kit, you'll need to update your package to get the latest changes.
npm update '@awesome.me/kit-fdadaa89ad'

its pretty simple if you have any issues let me know

 This will happen regardless of whether or not the seekbar was previously hidden. To maintain the state of the seekbar display, a state variable will be created, called isSeekbarDisplayed. An event listener should be created that listens to the bitmovin event that is fired when a stream is loaded and reads isSeekbarDisplayed and either hides or shows the seekbar depending on itâ€™s value.
